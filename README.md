### Interests

Currently learning and exploring different areas in computer science â€” mostly systems programming, networking, and some theoretical topics.  
Not trying to master everything at once, just figuring out what I enjoy and where I can improve over time.

---

### Tools & Languages

Comfortable with Rust and C/C++ (used mostly through problem solving and practice).  
Also working with basic Go, Elixir (still learning), and Python (when necessary).

- Collaborations  
- Side projects  
- Internships and lab work (in the future)

Still just trying to make things work without breaking them. Thatâ€™s progress, right?
